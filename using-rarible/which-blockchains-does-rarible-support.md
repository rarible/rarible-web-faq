Rarible is a multichain marketplace, meaning you can buy, mint and sell NFTs on multiple blockchains.

More specifically, that means you can choose which audience you want to reach, the carbon footprint you’re comfortable with and the fees you want to pay.

The Web3 space has no bounds, so neither do we.

Rarible currently supports Ethereum, Polygon, Solana and Tezos, although we’re planning to integrate more blockchains in the near future.

You can switch between the supported blockchains under the “Explore” tab on Rarible.com. When you mint your (first) NFT, you need to choose which blockchain it’s on.

Important note: Once you’ve minted an NFT on one blockchain, you can’t move it to another. You can mint the same artwork on multiple blockchains by creating multiple NFTs.
